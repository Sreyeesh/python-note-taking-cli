## Testing NoteApp

- We use `pytest` for testing the application.
- The `pytest.ini` file ensures the project root is included in Pythonâ€™s module search path, simplifying test execution.
- To run tests locally:
  ```bash
  pytest

## CI/CD Pipeline

- The GitHub Actions workflow (`python-ci.yml`) ensures automated testing on every push to the `main` branch.
- Key updates:
  - Added `pytest.ini` for simplified test configuration.
  - Verified that the workflow successfully passes all tests.

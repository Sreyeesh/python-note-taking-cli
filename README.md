All notes are saved to a `notes.json` file in the project directory. This file is automatically updated whenever notes are added, modified, or deleted.

- **Backup or Reset**:
  - To back up your notes, copy the `notes.json` file to another location.
  - To reset the application, delete the `notes.json` file:
    ```bash
    rm notes.json
    ```

## Testing

### Run Automated Tests
We use `pytest` for automated testing. To run the tests, execute:
```bash
pytest
```

### Coverage Report (Optional)
To measure test coverage, install `pytest-cov` and run:
```bash
pip install pytest-cov
pytest --cov=app
```

**Example Output**:
```plaintext
---------- coverage: platform linux, python 3.10 ----------

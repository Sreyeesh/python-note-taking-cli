# Repository Cleanup Tasks

- [x] Move data files (e.g., import_notes.csv, notes.csv) to a dedicated data/ directory.
- [x] Move main.py to the app/ directory to keep core application logic in one place.
- [x] Clean up temporary and cache files (__pycache__, .pytest_cache).
- [x] Update .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files and directories.
- [x] Update README.md to reflect the new project structure.

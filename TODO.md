# TODO

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Implement Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Configure CI workflow to automate the following:
  - Run Black for code formatting checks.
  - Run Flake8 for linting.
  - Execute Pytest to verify the test suite.
- [ ] Ensure CI workflows trigger on:
  - Code pushes to `main` or `feature/*` branches.
  - Pull request creation and updates.
- [ ] Verify that all CI steps pass without errors.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Refactored codebase to adhere to PEP 8 standards.
- [x] Applied Black for code formatting.
- [x] Resolved Flake8 linting errors.
- [x] Organized test files and verified test coverage.
- [x] Updated `.flake8` configuration to align with Black.

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Integrate code coverage analysis into the CI pipeline.
- [ ] Automate deployment for staging and production environments.
- [ ] Add dependency vulnerability checks using `pip-audit`.
